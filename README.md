# React Currency Converter App

This is a React application written in TypeScript that allows users to convert between different currencies. The app uses a backend API in Golang to fetch the conversion rates.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js**: Required to run the app. Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node.js comes with npm pre-installed. Verify the installation by running:

  ```sh
  npm -v
  ```

- **TypeScript**: Although TypeScript comes installed as a dependency, you can globally install TypeScript to use it directly in the command line:

  ```sh
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/a-drawn-pixel/react_currency_converter.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and go to this address to view your application.

## Testing

To run the tests for the application, use:

```sh
npm run test
```

This will execute the test suite configured for the app, providing feedback on any test cases that pass or fail.
